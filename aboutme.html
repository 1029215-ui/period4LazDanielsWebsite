    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Daniel, and this is my website where I share my interests and projects.</p>
	  
	  <h3>It began with the idea of wanting to learn what I could create when working with technology</h3>
    <p>This is my secodn year at El Camino High School and I first became fascinated by how people used software to create visual art and crafts, which sparked my curiosity and led me to explore further. As I delved into 3D design and gained some hands-on experience, I realized how much I enjoyed working with digital tools and experimenting with creative possibilities. This naturally led me to explore Graphic Design and now Web Design.</p>

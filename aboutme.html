    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Daniel, and this is my website where I share my interests and projects.</p>
	  
	  <h3>It began with the idea of wanting to learn what I could create when working with technology</h3>
    <p>This is my second year at El Camino High School, and I first became fascinated by how people used software to create visual art and crafts, which sparked my curiosity and led me to explore further. As I delved into 3D design and gained some hands-on experience, I realized how much I enjoyed working with digital tools and experimenting with creative possibilities. This naturally led me to explore Graphic Design and now Web Design.</p>
    <p>In my time here at El Camino, I have participated in the Graphic Design course, where I learned how to alter and transform images using Adobe Photoshop, as well as create and replicate designs using different shapes in Adobe Illustrator. A highlight of this couse was developing my own brand, designing a unique logo for it, and creating a statement that reflects my personal vision.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I am now enrolled in the Web Design course, where I am learning how to build my own website completely from scratch. This includes creating individual pages using HTML and combining both creativity and technical skills to bring my ideas to life online. This hands-on experience is helping me strengthen both my technical skills and my ability to design and manage content across multiple web pages.&nbsp;</p>
